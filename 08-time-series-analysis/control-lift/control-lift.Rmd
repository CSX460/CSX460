Your job is to create a model for the control lift stability of a hypotetical 
aircraft. 

Download and the data at "~/data/control-lift.rds". Create a model for the 
control lift response as a function of alpha (angle of attach) and 
beta (roll angle) for the hypothetical aircraft. 

Show all work:

```r

```

How good is your model?

What did you find surprising?
