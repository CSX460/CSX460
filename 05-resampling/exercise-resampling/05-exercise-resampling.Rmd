## Resampling

`x` is a random variable. We want to not only know what the `mean(x)` is but want to calculate the uncertainty of `mean(x)`.  Measuring the uncertainty requires repeated measurements of `mean(x)`.

- Calculate the mean of `x`.
- Calculte the `sd( mean(x) )` using the **using 10-fold resampling**.  Create your own folds, show your work.
- Calculte the `sd( mean(x) )` using the **using 10 bootstrap sample**.  Create your own folds, show your work. 

```{r}
set.seed(1) 
x <- runif(20,1,20)

sd_cv # <- Your work here 

sd_boot # <- Your work here
```


### Your answers here: 

- sd_cv   is: `r sd_cv`
- sd_boot is: `r sd_boot`
