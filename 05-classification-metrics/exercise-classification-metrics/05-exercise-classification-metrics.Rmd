## Classification Metrics Functions 

Write functions of `y` and `y_hat` to calculate the following classification metrics

* True Positive Rate  
* False Positive Rate
* True Negative Rate  
* False Negative Rate 
* Sensitivity 
* Specificity 
* Recall 
* Precision
* Prevalence 
* Accuracy
* Kappa

```{r "definitions", echo=FALSE}


```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.


## Usage 

Use the function(s) above to calculate the metrics for your late arrival model that
you created last week. 

```{r "evaluations"}


```
