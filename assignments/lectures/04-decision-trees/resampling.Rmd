```{r}
set.seed(314159)
```


Use the `baseball` data set from the `plyr` package for the following problem.

A very simple model to predict the number of at-bats/game **each** player has per game is given by: 
 
     abpg = sum(ab)/sum(g)  # 3.10
     

- Show that this is a bad:

```{r}

```



- Create a better model using only number of games as a predictor

```{r}


```


- Calculate the "Apparent" *RMSE* of this model.    

```{r}



```


Using only Recreate the model, providing a new estimate for `ab/g` and the RMSE, using:
- 5-Fold CV
- Bootstrap

```{r}



```
