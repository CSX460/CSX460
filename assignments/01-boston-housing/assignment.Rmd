All assignments should be submitted to the github repository using a branch created wit you initials. For Example,

    git clone https://github.com/csx460/week2
    git checkout -b ctb
    (work)
    git add ...
    git commit ...
    git push into your repo and issue a pull request.    


Place answers directly in the files.

Feel free to push your answers when you are complete 


Assignments:

* Please Read Chapters 1-3 of Applied Predictive Modeling 


* Submit via email a project proposal: A description of your project that includes:
** The objective, what you expect to achieve with the model
** data source(s)
** responses
** expected (hypothesized) predictors
** how the model will be used 
** how you will determine the measure of success of the model


# 1.  Do the boston-housing.Rmd assignment in github.
Don't forget to show your works, plots included.


# 2. Algorithms and Functions

When speaking of Machine Learning, there are two functions or algorithms involved.
Describe and differentiate the algorithms from the function.
Function is mathmatical means of solving problem, they are blocks of computer program.
Alogrithm is abstract concept of describing how people solve the problem, which include the specific steps of getting things done.

# 2. RMSE and MAE

Why is RMSE preferrable to MAE?  
RMSE give weights to the points that are further away from the mean, which reflet the quality of the data better than the MAE. MAE
When is MAE better?
