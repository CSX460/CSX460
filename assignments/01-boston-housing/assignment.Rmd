All assignments should be submitted to the github repository using a branch created wit you initials. For Example,

    git clone https://github.com/csx460/week2
    git checkout -b ctb
    (work)
    git add ...
    git commit ...
    git push into your repo and issue a pull request.    


Place answers directly in the files.

Feel free to push your answers when you are complete 


Assignments:

* Please Read Chapters 1-3 of Applied Predictive Modeling 


* Submit via email a project proposal: A description of your project that includes:
** The objective, what you expect to achieve with the model
** data source(s)
** responses
** expected (hypothesized) predictors
** how the model will be used 
** how you will determine the measure of success of the model


# 1.  Do the boston-housing.Rmd assignment in github.
Don't forget to show your works, plots included.

The code is in BostonHousing.Rmd.


# 2. Algorithms and Functions

When speaking of Machine Learning, there are two functions or algorithms involved.
Describe and differentiate the algorithms from the function.

Basically, algorithms are different kinds of methods implemented by the function, which used to solve a kind of problem with limited time and space.
Functions are relations between a set of inputs and a set of permissible outputs.


# 2. RMSE and MAE

Why is RMSE preferrable to MAE?  
When is MAE better? 

RMSE represents for root-mean-square error, which describe the measures of mispersion of the sample, but MAE is used to measure how close predictions are to the eventual outcomes, it can not show the mispersion.
I think MAE is better when we want to see how far predictions are to the average value.
