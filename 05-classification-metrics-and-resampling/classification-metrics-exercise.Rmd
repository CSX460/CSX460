Using the first **logistic regression** model that you created in previous exercise; 

1. Partition the model into Test and Training Sets using only `base::sample` 

```{r}

```

2. Re-train the model on the training data 

```{r}

```

3. Using the `predict` function and `test` data, write functions to calculate and 
calculate: 

* Misclassification Rate
* Prevalence 
* Accuracy
* Accuracy
* Error Rate / Misclassification Rate
* True Positive Rate  
* False Positive Rate
* True Negative Rate  
* False Negative Rate 
* Sensitivity 
* Specificity 
* Recall 
* Precision

```{r, echo=FALSE}


```
