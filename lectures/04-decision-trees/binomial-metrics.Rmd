The German Credit Data (data/german_credit); 

1. Read in the German Credit Data
2. Partition the model int Test and Training 
 

```{r}


```

Use the predict function on test data ... calculate:
* True Positive Rate  
* False Positive Rate
* True Negative Rate  
* False Negative Rate 
* Sensitivity 
* Specificity 
* Recall 
* Precision
* Prevalence 
* Accuracy


```{r, echo=FALSE}

```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
