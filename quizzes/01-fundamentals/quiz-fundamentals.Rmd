# Question 1:

In Machine Learning 
1. What are at least 3 names for the Y values 
2. What are at least 3 names for the X values



# Question 2:

It is often useful to plot a scatter plot of your data with each X against the Y. 
What can you understand from these plots

1. 
2.



# Question 3: 

Consider the **summary** of a lm model: 

    Call:
    lm(formula = Sepal.Length ~ . - Species, data = iris)
    
    Residuals:
         Min       1Q   Median       3Q      Max 
    -0.82816 -0.21989  0.01875  0.19709  0.84570 
    
    Coefficients:
                 Estimate Std. Error t value Pr(>|t|)    
    (Intercept)   1.85600    0.25078   7.401 9.85e-12 ***
    Sepal.Width   0.65084    0.06665   9.765  < 2e-16 ***
    Petal.Length  0.70913    0.05672  12.502  < 2e-16 ***
    Petal.Width  -0.55648    0.12755  -4.363 2.41e-05 ***

    Signif. codes:  0  €˜*** €™ 0.001  €˜** €™ 0.01  €˜* €™ 0.05  €˜. €™ 0.1  €˜  €™ 1
    
    Residual standard error: 0.3145 on 146 degrees of freedom
    Multiple R-squared:  0.8586,	Adjusted R-squared:  0.8557 
    F-statistic: 295.5 on 3 and 146 DF,  p-value: < 2.2e-16

What is/are:

1. The Y: 
2. The X's:
3. The full (model) formula for the model: 
If all units are the same (they are), which variable has the 
4a.largest absolute impact on Y.
4b. smallest absolute impact on Y.


  
  
# Question 4: 

Name (the) three things are that all ML algorithm share in common?
1. 
2.
3.
